## Installation

To set up ChatPDF Pro locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rjaat/Chat-With-PDF.git
   cd Chat-With-PDF
2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**

     ```
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
4. **Download the Required Models:**
     The project uses the MBZUAI/LaMini-T5-738M model. You can download it using the following:
     ```
     from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
     checkpoint = "MBZUAI/LaMini-T5-738M"
     tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
     model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint)
     ```
## Usage
1. ***Run the Streamlit App:***
     ```
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
2. ***Upload a PDF File:***
